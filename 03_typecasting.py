a = "35553" #this is under double quotation so this is string
# lets try to change in integer
# if in case there is name like Suraj, it cannot change to integer
a = int(a)
print(a + 5)
# str(31) ==> "31" This is integer to string
# int("32") ==> 32 This is string to integer conversion
# foat (32) ==> 32.0 This is float conversion
